Hello, my name is Savannah Chasing Hawk. My pronouns are she/her, and I am a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. I originally got my bachelors from Cornell University for architecture. I'm currently in the Tech Elevator bootcamp to become a Software Developer. After I finish, there are a variety of projects I would love to work on any number of project types. 

Fun Fact: I have a lil chihuahua name Solo (like Han Solo)! Lately, we've had to put his sweaters on cause he hates the winter cold.
